Title
Leak-safe churn prediction on KKBOX with calibrated actions

Problem and metric
Predict churn one month ahead. Score on log loss. See CITES.md.

Approach

* Rebuilt labels with the 30-day rule and tests.
* DuckDB features with as-of windows and a leak audit.
* Baselines, XGBoost, isotonic calibration.
* Rolling backtests across three months.
* SHAP reasons. Rules for next best action.

Results  [fill with measured numbers]

* Log loss. pre = A, post = B.
* ROC AUC. C with 95% CI.
* Brier. D with improved reliability.
* Backtests. Feb→Mar = E, Mar→Apr = F, Apr→May = G.
* Drift. PSI for features and score within thresholds.

Demo

* Retention Copilot. Member id or CSV upload.
* Output. score, top 3 reasons, next action.

Reproducibility

* One command. make all.
* Docker and green CI on a 1k synthetic fixture.
